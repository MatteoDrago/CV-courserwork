\section{Introduction}
All the code for this coursework has been written in \MATLAB. 

In all our algorithms we used \code{imageDatastore} in order to speed up images retrieval and manipulation. In particular, we decided to use 25\% of the training set for validation: in this way we tested our different algorithms multiple times and in different configuration before categorizing the test set. The split of the training set, where possible, has been done with \code{splitEachLabel}.
